We offer paid internships for full-time students in software development, sales, marketing, and more.\nJoin any meeting or office in our company —we bet you can’t tell an intern from a full-timer. TechSmith is a perfect place to grow your skills alongside your time in the classroom.\n\n{DEVELOP} differently\nCome as you are. At TechSmith, it’s about the work you do, not what you wear. Our dress code is laidback so everyone is comfortable and can focus on what matters most —helping our customers stand out and share what they know.\nWe’re all equal, really. Everyone at TechSmith is valued and accessible. Doors —and minds —are open. Your voice matters, not your title. Company leaders will know your name and are eager for your ideas. You are trusted and empowered to make decisions and get the job done.\n\n{DEVELOP} together\nAs soon as you accept your role at TechSmith, you’re officially a “TechSmithie.” It’s like you’ve found your people —smart, fun, and slightly nerdy (OK, maybe a lot nerdy). Each TechSmithie adds their own unique spice to our ever-changing culture. What will you bring to the mix?\n\nPosition Overview:\n\nAs a Software Engineer Intern, Full Stack at TechSmith, you will be putting your problem-solving skills and passion for developing great software to use every day. You will work within a team, building the systems that support our world-class software products in a fun, collaborative environment. The software that you create will be a part of TechSmith’s image and video sharing platforms. You will see your changes going live on our sites on a regular basis.\nYour day-to-day responsibilities will include participating in an agile team, programming, estimating upcoming work, reviewing completed work with teammates, as well as other duties, as assigned. If you love technology and solving problems you will fit right in.\n\nAt TechSmith, every individual can make a big impact, while working in a supportive team environment. As part of an agile development team, you will have a voice in helping to decide what assignments the team takes on. While working directly with User Experience Designers and Product Owners, you will help to decide how to solve our customer’s needs. With the help of Software Test Specialists and your teammates, you will have the time and support to fully test your solutions and create quality work. When you are not coding solutions for customers, you will have the time to advance your skills with the help and support of your programming lead and manager.\n\nRequired Skills and Background:\n• Plan to be enrolled in classes in the summer or fall of 2024, working towards a degree in Computer Science, or a closely related field.

      "job_description": "Job Description\nABOUT BOSE\nYou know the moment. It’s the first notes of that song you love, the intro to your favorite movie, or simply the sound of someone you love saying “hello.” It’s in these moments that sound matters most.\n\nAt Bose, we believe sound is the most powerful force on earth. And we’ve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, “I can make this better,” we’ve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing.\n\nInnovation is more than what we do. It’s who we are — constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like. We’re music fanatics and audio engineers. We’re explorers and inventors and dreamers. And we’re passionate down to our bones about making whatever you’re listening to a little more magical.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\nWe're looking for students to join our Internship Program who are obsessively curious about 'what's next'. You'll get hands on experience with our products and learn from the best of the best in the business. You will complete a specific project in 10-12 weeks with us, while integrating into your team. By the time you end your time with us, you will have been given the opportunity to truly make a real impact in the future of Bose and your career!\n\nOpportunities don't stop at your day-to-day work. While you're getting a targeted look at your area of expertise, we'll expose you to other areas of the company. Our interns are given the opportunity to connect with senior leadership across the business to understand different perspectives at Bose. You'll network with other interns and colleagues to grow your network for the future!\n\nTimeframe - June-August 2024\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nThe Bose Software Organization is looking for a Summer Intern to help us bring new experiences to our customers. Bose is building the platforms and tools that will allow us to rapidly develop, test, distribute and evaluate new software concepts, bringing new apps and algorithms to our existing and next-generation products. The software components that we build will accelerate concept development, allowing us to test out new ideas within Bose and in our new public Beta program.\n\nWe are creating a pipeline of new software experiences that will deliver clear value to our customers. The unique structure of our project means that while individual experiences come and go, the tools and libraries that we build are re-used and enhanced over time. With each new experience, we have the opportunity to solve new problems and improve the tools available across the company.\n\nAs a developer you will work closely with a team to design and build our cloud platform to bring new software experiences to life.\n\nGoals:\n\n• Design, implement, test, and deploy microservices in a CICD pipeline that provide REST interfaces to mobile apps and other microservices.\n\n• Work with architects and product owners to translate requirements into the next set of cloud functionality.\n\n• Write well-designed and fully tested production-quality code.\n\nLearning Opportunities\n\n• Hone your cloud microservice development skills on an exciting project using innovative technologies.\n\n• Design, implement and test REST APIs.\n\n• Work within a modern agile software engineering team.\n\n• Gain experience with the tools and processes used to build high-quality software, including automated testing, peer code reviews.\n\n• Learn to balance the immediate deliverables for a project with the long-term platform vision.\n\nWhat we’re looking for:\n\n• Degree path in engineering, computer science or a related technical field\n\n• Good Computer Science fundamentals in object-oriented design and data structures\n\n• Experience in cloud microservice and development in Python and/or Go\n\n• Effective communication skills at building relationships across teams\n\n• Taking initiative and self-starter, as part of a team\n\nBose is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity.
