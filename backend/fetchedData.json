You will be asked to state your preferred internship dates on your application form\n• Location: This role is available in our Boston office\n\nAbout the Role\n\nThis position is ideal for current students and recent graduates with a degree in an economic, mathematical or computer science discipline seeking to gain an insight into life at a fast-growing consultancy serving clients from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nYou will get the opportunity to join a growing Health Economics team and gain hands-on experience in designing, developing and communicating health economic models. These can range from simple costing tools to substantially more complicated models that aim to demonstrate the value of products and therapies to reimbursement agencies.\n\nThe Health Economics team at Costello Medical develop economic models to inform decisions on the efficient allocation of resources available to healthcare providers, and communicate these insights to a variety of stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Economic models within the realm of healthcare are quantitative assessments of the impact of healthcare treatments, practices and policies, either through cost-effectiveness analyses or separate cost and benefit considerations. These models are typically built in Microsoft Excel, C++, or R, employing universal mathematical and statistical modelling techniques. Model development can frequently involve fitting statistical distributions and parametric survival curves to clinical data and therefore requires a good knowledge of statistics. The models developed by our Health Economics team have real-world implications, aiming to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems by using robust methodological frameworks to inform decision-making.\n\nProducing an economic evaluation therefore requires Health Economics Interns to:\n• Research and critically appraise medical and economic literature\n• Work collaboratively and build relationships with colleagues\n• Understand theoretical health economic frameworks and apply these to the project at hand\n• Build high-quality, technically robust and clinically valid models in Microsoft Excel\n• Interpret and analyze model results, producing technically accurate written reports of methodologies and outcomes\n\nHealth Economics Interns at Costello Medical receive one-to-one training on the technical aspects of the role and learn about project management and effective communication with clients. In this role, you will typically be working on approximately three projects at any one time.\n\nCareer Prospects After the Internship\n\nDuring the internship program, there is the opportunity for strong candidates to apply for the Health Economist role and join our expanding team on a permanent basis. This is a route which is encouraged, and that many current colleagues have taken across a variety of divisions.\n\nTo learn more about the personal and professional development we offer at Costello Medical, please click below to read firsthand accounts from our colleagues about their time with the company: https://www.costellomedical.com/careers/working-at-costello-medical/\n\nAbout You\n\nThis internship is suited to recent graduates as well as current students who are permitted to complete full time internships over the summer.\n\nQualities and experience required include:\n• A degree level or higher qualification in a relevant discipline (minimum GPA 3.3 or equivalent).

We collaborate closely with public- and private-sector partners to translate big questions into deep insights that improve interventions, refine strategies, and enhance understanding. Our work yields actionable information to guide decisions in wide-ranging policy areas, from health, education, early childhood, and family support to nutrition, employment, disability, and international development. As a fully employee-owned firm, Mathematica is dedicated to defining and advancing our mission to improve public well-being by bringing the highest standards of quality, objectivity, and excellence in information collection and analysis for our clients. At Mathematica, we take pride in our commitment to diversity.

They should possess excellent communication skills, a proactive approach to work, and a genuine interest in healthcare. Advanced Excel and/or R skills would be advantageous but not necessary. No previous health economics experience is required, but a curiosity to learn about new areas of health economic modelling is essential.\n• The Health Economics Intern will research and analyze medical and economic literature, build models in Excel, interpret results, and produce reports for multiple projects.\n• This position is ideal for current students and recent graduates with a degree in an economic, mathematical or computer science discipline seeking to gain an insight into life at a fast-growing consultancy serving clients from the pharmaceutical industry.\n• You will get the opportunity to join a growing Health Economics team and gain hands-on experience in designing, developing and communicating health economic models. These can range from simple costing tools to substantially more complicated models that aim to demonstrate the value of products and therapies to reimbursement agencies.\n• The Health Economics team at Costello Medical develop economic models to inform decisions on the efficient allocation of resources available to healthcare providers, and communicate these insights to a variety of stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Economic models within the realm of healthcare are quantitative assessments of the impact of healthcare treatments, practices and policies, either through cost-effectiveness analyses or separate cost and benefit considerations. These models are typically built in Microsoft Excel, C++, or R, employing universal mathematical and statistical modelling techniques. Model development can frequently involve fitting statistical distributions and parametric survival curves to clinical data and therefore requires a good knowledge of statistics. The models developed by our Health Economics team have real-world implications, aiming to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems by using robust methodological frameworks to inform decision-making.\n\nRequirements:\n• This internship is suited to recent graduates as well as current students who are permitted to complete full time internships either during the holidays or as a placement as a part of their degree. This role is suited to those with a curious mind and the desire to contribute above and beyond expectations in projects.\n• Essential requirements for the role are:\n• An undergraduate degree level qualification in an economic, mathematical or computer science discipline (minimum 2.1 or equivalent). Postgraduate qualifications (minimum 2.1 or equivalent) would be an advantage, but they are not a requirement for the role\n• An A-level in Mathematics (minimum B grade or equivalent)\n• An excellent level of attention to detail in both quantitative and qualitative settings\n• Strong organisational skills, the ability to plan your own work effectively and the flexibility to respond to changing deadlines\n• The ability to communicate mathematical and economic material clearly in both written and oral formats\n• A problem-solving mindset and eagerness to work both independently and collaboratively to find solutions\n• Integrity, a proactive approach to your work, and a keen interest in developing your skills\n• In addition, advanced skills in Excel and/or R would be an advantage, but are not a necessity. Although no previous health economics experience is required, you must be able to display a genuine interest in healthcare and an eagerness to learn about new areas of health economic modelling.\n\nResponsibilities:\n• Producing an economic evaluation therefore requires Health Economics Interns to:\n• Research and critically appraise medical and economic literature\n• Work collaboratively and build relationships with colleagues\n• Understand theoretical health economic frameworks and apply these to the project at hand\n• Build high-quality, technically robust and clinically valid models in Microsoft Excel\n• Interpret and analyze model results, producing technically accurate written reports of methodologies and outcomes\n• Health Economics Interns at Costello Medical receive one-to-one training on the technical aspects of the role and learn about project management and effective communication with clients. In this role, you will typically be working on approximately three projects at any one time.",
