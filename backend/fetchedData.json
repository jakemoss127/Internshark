Our team knows us as the best place in North Dakota to do what you love, and love what you do. Every. Day.\n\nYou should know us as a startup with a fast-paced culture. Every day we build, market, and support an amazing product that customers from 100+ countries love. Are you ready to join us?\n\nA Note On Degrees & Areas Of Concentration:\n\nThis role involves research and writing. We encourage you to apply if you’re passionate about writing, regardless of your majors and minors. Candidates who could succeed in this role include those learning about communications, marketing, journalism, and English. Again, if you don’t fit that bill but are intrigued by the position, take a shot and let us see if we can find a place for you! We want a diverse team full of varying perspectives that will help us all win together.\n\nPosition Overview:\n\nThis role is part of our Content Marketing team. As the marketing intern, you will be responsible for researching, writing, editing, publishing, and measuring content marketing for CoSchedule’s blog and web pages. You may also create, monitor, and engage social media content and followers.\n\nJob Summary:\n• Write high-quality search engine optimized (SEO) content that 100,000+ readers will consume every month.\n• Research and implement search engine optimization best practices to publish content that ranks on the first page of search engine results.\n• Maintain our popular newsletter that reaches 1,000,000+ readers every month.\n• Measure and report on newsletter, blog posts, search engine optimization, public relations performance and beyond.\n• Help update and maintain our social media presence online.\n• Assist with other marketing efforts as needed.\n• Kick ass.\n\nJob Requirements:\n• You’re an ambitious self-starter.\n• You’re deeply passionate about writing and editing.\n• You’re a grammar nerd.\n• You work well with minimal guidance but you ask lots of questions first to make sure you’re meeting expectations.\n• You like to focus but respect when the company asks you to pivot.\n• You’re detail- and goal-oriented.\n• You’re inquisitive and determined.\n• You have excellent communication skills.\n• You care deeply about the quality of the work you produce. You don’t stop at “good enough”.\n• Other duties as assigned.\n\nThe “That’d Be Great”:\n• Pursuing a degree in English (writing, editing, etc.), marketing, communications, journalism—that sort of thing.\n• Prior marketing, writing, or editing internship experiences.\n• Prior knowledge and/or experience with content marketing and search engine optimization.\n• You’re a Mac user and early adopter.\n• You relish reading marketing blogs and listening to TED talks in your downtime.\n\nAbout CoSchedule’s Marketing Internship Program:\n• The position may run 6-12 months in length (or more) and is available only for students enrolled in a higher education program. Hours range from 15-20 per week.\n• Ideally, we like to train interns to stick around for at least two semesters.\n• The internship will end upon graduation from a higher education program (or sooner). There is currently no plan to make this a full-time position—it is a temporary part-time internship position.\n\nWhat You Get From This Internship:\n• You will not make copies or fetch us coffee. We will try to maximize your schedule to complete as much work as you’re able to give you some great marketing experience for your resume.\n• This internship offers a “real work” experience. You will take on ownership of programs and projects with a team of marketers. Unlike some internships, this is not a fluffy “program” where you collaborate with other interns and pitch something creative or cutesy to higher-ups. You will be responsible for completing real marketing work that has a high potential for generating results. You will work as an extension of your manager to execute the marketing strategy. We see this more as a part-time, entry-level position rather than the standard definition of an internship.\n• You will get the opportunity to be a part of a collaborative marketing team that does world-class work. Our marketing team attracts millions of website visitors and converts hundreds of thousands of software users every year. Teamwork in business is different than in school—there are no free rides, and we all pull our weight.\n• You will get experience in the software as a service (SaaS) industry. We do things differently in our space because the internet is our marketplace—it’s global business at scale. If you’re interested in tech and marketing, an internship with us will be really fun.\n• You will work on projects that range from emails to newsletters, blog posts, web pages, and more. Most of the marketing work we do here is digital marketing.",

      "job_description": "Overview:\n\nGood Party is looking for an innovative and creative paid Social Media Marketing Intern who will create static content for the winter/spring semesters. You’ll receive mentorship from our Social Media Manager, Marketing Manager, and our marketing team. You’ll support all aspects of our Social Media team, from content strategy, content creation to influencer marketing. You’ll get experience with the day to day of an early stage startup and be managed by Good Party’s Social Media Manager, who previously ran Jury Duty’s accounts and has a personal brand with 300k+ followers.\n• Note: There is another internship opportunity for those interested in primarily creating video content.\n\nAbout Good Party:\n\nGood Party is the movement to make people matter more than money in our democracy.\n\nAt Good Party, we help real people run winning campaigns based on good ideas. We connect our supporters to these Good Candidates who will truly represent us in office.\n\nAmericans are losing faith in democracy – especially young people. The rigged, two party system has turned Independent into a dirty word to make voters trapped between voting for the lesser of two evils or wasting their vote on an alternative. Whether you’re concerned about the climate, privacy, inequality, or our individual freedoms, solutions are held back by the dark doom-loop of dysfunctional partisan politics.\n\nWe recognize that Independent and 3rd party candidates lack the resources to be viable against Republicans and Democrats, even though a majority of Americans are Independent. In fact, a majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans, nor Democrats represent them…but they keep getting elected!\n\nGood Party’s solution is to provide candidates who take our pledge with cutting-edge tech tools to win, without selling out to the Democrats or Republicans. We are building a community to end the corrupt two party system and then harnessing that community’s collective power to elect the most promising independents around the country. By leveraging social media and creators, we’re making our mission to make people matter more than money mainstream.\n\nGood Party is founded by serial entrepreneur, Farhad Mohit, with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate.\n\nWhy you should work at Good Party:\n• Join us in solving the biggest problem of our time – fixing our democracy – so all other problems can be solved\n• We’re a Public Benefit Corporation that prioritizes social impact over making money\n• Work how you like, on a fully remote team spread across the country\n• Join a passionate team with diverse political views focused on one mission\n\nWhat you'll do:\n• Create static social media content for Instagram and Facebook that grows our audience and generates awareness of Good Party\n• Schedule out posts, engage with comments, and respond to DMs\n• Measure engagement on social media platforms and other marketing platforms\n• Contribute content ideas during weekly Writer’s Rooms\n• Research and maintain awareness of current social media trends\n• As part of an early stage tech start-up, you’ll have the opportunity to wear many hats and get exposure to various disciplines (e.g. mobilization, politics, product development)\n• You’ll work between 10-20 hours/week depending on your availability, producing 2-5 pieces of content a week\n\nWho we're looking for:\n• You’re up for the audacious challenge of transforming our democracy for Good\n• You’re a student in or recent graduate of an undergraduate or graduate program in marketing, graphic design, business, communications, humanities, or related field\n• You’ve got the grit to push through and make the impossible possible.\n• You thrive working at the startup speed that our mission demands\n• You have a strong interest in Social Media & have the desire to grow professionally in this field\n• You have experience creating content (specifically memes, infographics, and other static posts)\n• You live and breathe social media, you always introduce your friends to the latest trends\n• You can work independently and handle multiple work streams in a remote setting.\n• You’re able to pivot and re-prioritize at a moment’s notice.\n• You align with our team’s values: We Are – Honest, open, and mission-driven. We Believe – People are Good. We Create – Results that inspire and grow our movement. We Love – Freedom and owning responsibility for all that we do. We Party – Together with a purpose!\n\nThe pay rate for this remote position is $15/hour. We are not considering candidates currently based outside of the US, so please only apply if you are physically located in the US. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide sponsorship for any of our roles at this time.\n\nApply or spread the word:\n\nWe hope you'll apply!\n\nYou can also keep up with the latest by signing up at GoodParty.org.
